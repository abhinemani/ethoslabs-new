		  There are now hundreds of startups actively disrupting the $100B+ government technology ecosystem, working in thousands of jurisdictions, with the support of tens of millions of investment dollars. Yet — for those of us working in the field — we know that we have truly just scratched the surface. More support is needed to get to the next phase of govtech innovation: more sales traction for existing startups, more investments to help them grow, and more support and guidance as they reach scale in this new territory. That's what we offer at EthosLabs.

      <p class='light'>
	  Government technology is often critized: failed, massive projects that get more headlines than users. But the blame can't be placed on the public servants at work, desparately trying to get the job done with broken tools and outdated policies. Indeed, it's often those people who are the most keen on changing the system -- and that's who we want to work with. Based on experience working with hundreds of govtech leaders, EthosLabs is here to help them (read: you) find a better, modern way.
